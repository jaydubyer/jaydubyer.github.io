<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is my first webpage. I''m going to try and improve it over time.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will get better...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm hosting on GitHub Pages and will try and add a custom domain name in time.</P>
<p></p>
<p>First things to do:</p>
<li>Add some styling with a CSS file.</li>
<li>Add some Javascript maybe.</li>
<li>Structure the page code in an orderly fashion.</li>
<li>Ditch the Times New Roman.</li>
</body>
